Adds a dashboard widget that allows users to request a WerkPress theme customization from within WordPress.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a widget to the WordPress dashboard that allows users to submit a theme customization request from within WordPress itself, rather than having to visit [werkpress.com](http://werkpress.com). Come to think of it, you should visit us [there](http://werkpress.com) anyway.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the zip file to the `/wp-content/plugins` directory and unzip it.
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress.
3. Go to your WordPress Dashboard and find the new widget. Click and drag it to a convenient location, if desired.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does WerkPress do anything weird or evil with my contact information? =

No way. We will use your email address to contact you about your customization request and nothing more.

== Screenshots ==

1. The widget in all its glory.

== Changelog ==

= 0.5.1b =
